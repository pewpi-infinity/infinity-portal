# Infinity Build Agents

- **Rogers**: first visual identification, coin/gem/artifact.
- **Watson**: structure, timing, chronology, research tagging.
- **Gemini**: internet vision fallback.
- **Autopilot**: creates new pages/scripts from description.

## Agent Contract
1. Never ask for info we already have (image → identify).
2. Always output Infinity value + real-world value.
3. Always provide a next-action button (“send to vault”, “list to marketplace”).
